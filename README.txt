Welcome to my Asteroids Clone!

The controllers are:
	- W (Up-Arrow): Apply Thrust
	- D (Right-Arrow): Turn to Starboard
	- A (Left-Arrow): Turn to Port
	- SpaceBar: Fire Blaster

	- Escape: Quit game


The game will start with large asteroids spawning. 
Destroying big asteroids splits them into medium sized asteroids, and those split into small asteroids.

Each asteroid destroyed adds to your score (Displayed on terminal after player death):
	- Big Asteroid: 1 point
	- Medium Asteroid: 3 points
	- Small Asteroid: 5 points

Destroying all Big Asteroids causing more to spawn, so careful you don't get overwhelmed!

Good Luck!
